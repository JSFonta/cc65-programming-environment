This repository creates a simple programming environment for the MEGA65
using the CC65 C-language cross-compiler for Linux and similar operating
systems.

It includes a number of helpful library functions, e.g., in screen.c, memory.c
and hal.c that you can use in your own programs.

You probably want to modify main.c to start writing your own program.

To compile:

make

To run your program:

make run
